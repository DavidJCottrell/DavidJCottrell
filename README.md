> 👨🏻‍💻 Control Systems Engineer at UKAEA

Currently working professionally with Unreal Engine 5, React and .NET. I spend my spare time experimenting with different technologies and languages, but have recently gotten hooked on Game Engine design.

### Arnold Engine

My main personal project - a cross-platform game engine built with modern C++.
